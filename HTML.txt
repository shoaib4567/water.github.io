            <p class="h2--center">
Watermelon Game is a fun puzzle game where you have to put different fruits into a box one by one. The game gained great popularity in the second half of 2023 among Tiktok, Twitch and YouTube bloggers, as it combines the mechanics of such popular games as 2048 and Tetris.
<br>The goal of the game is to connect identical fruits and eventually get a large watermelon, and also collect as many points as possible. The game ends when the fruit completely fills the box and crosses the top line.
<br>The watermelon game is a great way to pass the time in a fun way or compete with friends in your ability to fold fruit compactly.
